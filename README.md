Flatiron Module 2 Linear regression Project

# Project Overview

Working with the FIFA 19 video game data, I'll be analyzing, the different aspects of the players game atributes to build a linear regression model that would predicit market value of the players in the top 5 leagues in Europe. The English, German, French, Italian and Spanish leagues.

# Approch

* my process had 6 parts:

* Getting my Data

* Cleaning and analyzing the data using Pandas

* Running Statistical tests on my data

* Visualizing our insights using Seaborn and Mathplotlib

* Engineering Features for my model

* Fiting my model




## Getting my data 
From Kaggle, I got the fifa 19 game data, complete with all the different attributes for each player.Each row contained each player in the game and the columns contain different information about them.

## Cleaning and analyzing the data using Pandas
I spent sevral hours cleaning the data using Pandas Dataframes and Series to prepare it for analysis. I removed or updated Null values. I group relevating information together and created new columns When necessary. I was able to select a data frame with just the players belonging to the top five leagues in Europe.I  also changed the datatypes of many columns so I could make calculations and comparisions acorss columns. 

## Running Statistical tests on my data
I ran sevral statistical test on my data. For example,  I ran an ANOVA test to see if the average age was the same accross the different leagues.

## Visualizing our insights using Seaborn and Mathplotlib

I explored my data and provided various visualiztions for the statistical tests I carried out and also to gain more insigt on the factors I considered to have and effect on how much a player is valued
